Enable Basic HTTP authentication on a service

## Purpose

This plugin adds the required code to use Passport Basic strategy on the generated NestJS application

## Configuration

None

## Usage

This plugin is integrarted with the default behaviour of the service by changing the `defaultAuth.guard.ts` file in the `auth` folder, so all guards on REST API controllers and GraphQL API resolvers will use this authentication by default.
