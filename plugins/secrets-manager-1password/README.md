[![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/@amplication/plugin-secrets-manager-1password)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amplication/plugin-secrets-manager-1password)

Amplication plugin that allows easy management of secrets by using 1Password.

## Purpose

This purpose of this plugin is to easily and securely use secrets by using 1Password.

## Configuration

The plugins are fetched by two methods:

- `STARTUP` - In this method, the plugins are fetched during the startup time (Initially loaded).
- `ON_DEMAND` - In this method, the plugins are fetched during the runtime (Loaded when the secrets are needed).

If you are choosing the `STARTUP` method, you need to define another property named `secretNames` that will contain a list of the secrets that needs to be loaded during startup time (see below for the formatting of the secret name).

Example:

```json
"fetchMode": "STARTUP",
"secretNames": [
    "/secretA",
    "/path/path2/secretB",
    "/path/path2/path3/secretC"
]

```

## Secret name format

The secret name must be formatted in either of the following way:

- `<secret_path>:<secret_name>` - This format specifies that a single secret named `secret_name` needs to be loaded from the `secret_path` path [applies to both fetch mode].
- `<secret_path>` - This format specifies that all the secrets that are in the `secret_path` needs to be loaded [only applies to `STARTUP` fetch mode].
