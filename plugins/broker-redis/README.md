Use a Redis message broker in the service generated by Amplication.

## Purpose

This plugin adds the required code to use Redis as a message broker in the service generated by Amplication.

It updates the following parts:
- Adds the required dependencies to `package.json`.
- Adds the required environment variables to `.env`.
- Adds a module `RedisModule` with a service `RedisProducerService` that can be used to emit messages
and a controller to respond to topic events.
- Adds the `RedisModule` configured to use Redis to the `app.module.ts` module imports list.
- Adds the required redis service to the `docker-compose.yml` as `docker-compose.dev.yml` files.

## Configuration

The `port` setting is the port that will be used for the url of the redis server.

The `host` setting is the host that will be used for the url of the redis server.

The `retryAttempts` setting is the number of times to retry a message.

The `retryDelay` setting is the delay between each message retry attempt.

The `enableTls` setting is set to true when TLS should be used.

If no configuration is provided the .amplicationrc.json file will use be used as the default values.

```json
{
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 6379,
    "retryAttempts": 3,
    "retryDelay": 3,
    "enableTls": false
}
```

## Scripts

### `build`

Running `npm run build` will bundle your plugin with Webpack for production.

### `dev`

Running `npm run dev` will watch your plugin's source code and automatically bundle it with every change.

### `test`

Running `npm run test` will run the plugin's test suite.

## Usage

This plugin provides you with a Redis broker module that you can use in your service.
To configure, set the following environment variables:

REDIS_BROKER_HOST - the host that will be used in the url of the Redis server.

REDIS_BROKER_PORT - the port that will be used in the url of the Redis server.

REDIS_BROKER_RETRY_ATTEMPTS - The number of times to retry a message.

REDIS_BROKER_RETRY_DELAY - The delay between each message retry attempt.

REDIS_BROKER_ENABLE_TLS - Set to "true" when TLS should be used.


An example of how to use the Redis module:

In a controller:

```js
export class ModelController extends ModelControllerBase {
    constructor(protected readonly service: ModelService, 
    private redisService: RedisProducerService) {
        super(service);
    }

    @Get()
    async respondToUser(): Promise<void> {
        await this.redisService.emit(MessageBrokerTopics.FirstTopic, { message: "hello, world!" });
        return "Done";
    }
}
```

Customization of the Redis controller to perform desired tasks:

```js
@Controller("redis-controller")
export class RedisController {
  @EventPattern("firstTopic")
  async onFirstTopic(
    @Payload()
    message: RedisMessage
  ): Promise<void> {
    console.log("Received message:", message);
  }
}
```
